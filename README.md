# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js: an unhandled exception within an asynchronous operation. The server crashes because the error isn't properly handled.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  `bugSolution.js` shows how to fix it using error handling within the asynchronous callback.
